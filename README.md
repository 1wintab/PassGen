+🎯 It's allowing users to create secure passwords based on selected parameters.

# 🌟 Key Features  

## ✔ **Password generation** with different character types:  
   - ✅ Numbers  
   ```csharp
    string numbers = "1234567890";
   ```
   - ✅ Uppercase letters  
   ```csharp
    string lowerLetters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
   ```
   - ✅ Lowercase letters  
   ```csharp
    string upperLetters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
   ```
   - ✅ Special characters  
   ```csharp
    string specialChars = "!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:'\"\\,.<>?/";
   ```

## 📌 How It Works

☑️ **Input validation** – prevents generating passwords without selected character types or specified length  

☑️ **Copy password** to clipboard  

☑️ **Clear entered data**  

☑️ **Error handling** – if an issue occurs, a **red dialog box** appears with an error message and plays the `error-uwu-sound-effect.wav`.
